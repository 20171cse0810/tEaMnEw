### The Complete Covid-Blog created For Covid Awreness 

This pandemic has brought suffering, fear, and death to populations everywhere. But its impact is not shared equally. Many of the most vulnerable have already suffered terribly due to a lack of State investment in healthcare for all. Others are living through conflicts, witnessing the erosion of International Humanitarian Law. As humanitarian teams have been partially evacuated and not replaced, those reliant on aid, and those suffering from neglected diseases, are suffering disproportionately. Others have been forced to flee their homes; forced to navigate a world where conventions protecting refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people are frequently disregarded, and where little consideration is given to migrants. This pandemic has brought suffering, fear, and death to populations everywhere. But its impact is not shared equally. Today, we must acknowledge that this pandemic comes after years of questioning humanitarian assistance and principles, and innumerable cases of violence against health workers and facilities. One of the terrible paradoxes now, is that the very governments that have created conditions in which the vulnerable are left disproportionately exposed to COVID-19, are the same governments who are now making calls for solidarity and cooperation. Whilst money is vital, financial contributions alone cannot fix healthcare inequality and exclusion. Use your influence, your power, your domestic and foreign policy, to bring healthcare for all. The COVID crisis amplifies and deepens existing inequalities. Healthcare for all people: without excluding the homeless or undocumented migrants, the prisoners, or indigenous people. They have all been terribly affected by COVID, as have the elderly in many countries. We have a duty to ensure no one is excluded from healthcare, and you will not be safe from the virus until you fulfil it. And that means marginalised communities too.
Healthcare workers all around the world are risking their lives to provide care. Today, we are still facing serious shortages of basic protective equipment. Without proper PPE, we cannot protect our staff and patients.
