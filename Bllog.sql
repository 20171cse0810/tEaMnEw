While countries such as China, Uruguay, and Vietnam have managed to contain the virus, others such as Brazil, India, and South Africa continue to grapple with a rise in infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerging markets are likely to face an uphill battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The economic impact has been even more severe as emerging market economies were buffeted by multiple shocks. Compounding the effects of domestic containment measures has been a decline in external demand. Particularly hit are tourism-dependent countries due to a decline in travel and oil exporters as commodity prices plummeted. With global trade and oil prices projected to drop by more than 10 percent and 40 percent respectively, emerging market economies are likely to face an uphill battle. This is even as capital outflows have stabilized and sovereign spreads retreated compared to the sharply volatile market conditions seen in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the IMF&rsquo;s latest June World Economic Outlook Update projects emerging market economies to shrink by 3.2 percent this year&mdash;the largest drop for this group on record. By way of comparison, in the global financial crisis, growth for the group took a significant hit but still bottomed out at a positive 2.6 percent in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decisive policy response</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crisis would have been worse still without extraordinary policy support. For sure, decisive policy actions in advanced economies led to a turnaround in market conditions that allowed emerging market economies to resume external financing efforts in April and May, which contributed to record levels of bond issuance so far this year&mdash;to the tune of $124 billion as of the end of June. But not all countries have seen improved fortunes. Fuel exporters, frontier countries, and those with high debt are experiencing a greater financial shock that pushed up borrowing costs, or even worse, denied them further access to markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy support by advanced economies provided emerging market economy policymakers with a wiggle room to soften the economic blow. Unlike previous episodes, where emerging market economies tended to tighten policy to avoid rapid capital outflows and the inflationary effect of exchange rate depreciation, the current crisis has seen emerging market economies&rsquo; policy reaction more in line with that of advanced economies (see the IMF&rsquo;s policy tracker). Most emerging market economies used reserve buffers more sparingly and allowed exchange rates to adjust to a larger extent, while many countries injected liquidity as needed to ensure market functioning. Countries like Poland and Indonesia further eased macroprudential policies to support credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 7, '359.png', '2020-08-09', 0),

From masks and toilet paper to hand sanitizer and other basic necessities&hellip; I am seeing marketers buying them and then reselling them on eBay or running ads and selling them for 10-50x the price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t entrepreneurship and this isn&rsquo;t marketing. I highly recommend that you avoid exploiting the Coronavirus situation to make a quick buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is it wrong but it is also very short-sighted. Sure you may be able to make a quick buck, but it won&rsquo;t last&hellip; you are better off spending your time on anything that is long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now that we got that out of the way, what does the Coronavirus mean for marketers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Businesses are going to struggle for a while<br />\r\nEven if the virus slows down fast as the numbers have dropped in China, businesses are going to struggle for well over a year because they will have to make up for their losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in China the virus caused retail sales to drop by 20.5% and the unemployment rate jumped to 6.2 in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When companies like Apple shut down their stores to help reduce the spread, it means less income and less profit. Sure they are able to pay their employees during their temporary shutdown, but not all companies have their bank balance and most won&rsquo;t be able to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just look at the travel industry. The virus is expected to lose them 820 billion dollars. Virgin Atlantic just asked their staff to take an 8-week unpaid leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ports are also empty and the first rounds of layoffs have already started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that in total COVID-19 will cost the global economy $2.7 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not only are people losing money but they are losing traffic and conversions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organic traffic is down in most industries<br />\r\nAs I mentioned above, we work with hundreds of clients in different industries through my agency. On top of that, we also have tons of data because of Ubersuggest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I dive into the data, note that we didn&rsquo;t focus on any one single country, we decide to look at the traffic stats from a global perspective. We also didn&rsquo;t include data from sites with less than 5000 visitors a month as they tend to have drastic swings from a percentage perspective even when there are no global issues or algorithm updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also don&rsquo;t have data on every single industry, for example, we don&rsquo;t really work with many restaurants nor do we purchase data for that category as local restaurants usually don&rsquo;t have the biggest marketing budgets. We have data on most of the major ones, but again not all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, from an SEO standpoint, last week we saw huge drops in organic traffic for most industries we are tracking. Just look at the chart below (compares last week to the previous week).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf you are in the news industry or financial space, your traffic skyrocketed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you are in the travel industry, you saw massive drops in traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t tell by the chart, but e-commerce was a mixed bag, depending on what sites sold, traffic was either up or down. For example, if you were selling baby products like diapers or wipes then you saw a nice bump in traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you were selling luxury goods like big-screen televisions you saw a drop in traffic.</p>\r\n', 7, '421.png', '2020-08-09', 2),
(23, 'Communications on COVID-19', '<p>Right communication strategy and leveraging technology is an important strategy to deal with the COVID19 pandemic. As we move ahead to the critical stage wherein certain activities have been allowed in Green and Orange Zones, there is a need for a communication strategy that helps drive behavioural change and ushers in an era wherein we may need to learn to live with the virus. This requires effective two way communications between the citizens and Government which has been the core strength of MyGov. It has been the endeavour of MyGov to act as a bridge between citizens and government and ensure citizen participation and information dissemination on platforms that most citizens use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the pandemic began, it was realised that words and phrases like Quarantine, Social Distancing, Lockdown need to be communicated well. Most people didn&rsquo;t know what these terms meant. Social distancing was an alien concept. Epidemiologists and health experts came up with Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts for preventing the spread of the Virus. Fake News and Myth Busters was another challenge that MyGov had to deal with. We had all kinds of conspiracy theories ranging from Wuhan Lab experiment gone wrong to use of hot water and garlic to kill the Virus. There was a need to bust these myths and focus on making interventions like use of Masks and washing hands for 20 seconds, the norm. This was done with explanatory infographics and videos that helped explain all these in simple language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards this objective, MyGov India, the citizen engagement platform of Government of India launched several initiatives on its MyGov.in platform as also its dedicated COVID19 page &ndash; corona.mygov.in to support the communication efforts of Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare. MyGov has a presence on almost all social media platforms that include not only the conventional ones like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn but for COVID19 campaign, MyGov is also using the unconventional platforms like Telegram, TikTok, Helo, VMate, Likee with an objective to reach out to all sections of people by leveraging all channels and platforms. Content was created in multiple languages as also the sign language to ensure that everyone becomes part of the communications. Videos from reputed doctors were made to ensure clear and correct messaging. MyGov also launched its MyGov Saathi Chatbot that is available on WhatsApp &amp; FB Messenger and is also available on https://mygov.in and https://self4society.mygov.in . MyGov Saathi is a mobile enabled platform and uses a menu-driven approach, allowing users to select available options such as &ldquo;Latest Update on Coronavirus in India&rdquo;, &ldquo;State level Status&rdquo;, &ldquo;Useful Alerts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where to get help&rdquo; to access information. It provides ready access to Covid-19 related resources such as latest updates, helplines, advisories from various central and state government departments as well as access to Self4Society initiatives including donation and volunteering opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key feature of the communications in COVID19 campaign is the ability to ensure adherence to lockdown regulations which are amongst the strictest in the world and has contributed greatly in limiting the spread of the pandemic and bringing down the rate of doubling of cases, which is essential for flattening the curve. This was made possible by the calls made by Prime Minister for the Janata Curfew, cheering doctors with clapping, 9PM9Minute lamp lighting, showering of petals etc. Some may not find any merit or value in these initiatives, but when we did the sentiment analysis of the social media posts, it was found that a vast majority of people supported these measures. We also launched the Pledges around these campaigns &ndash; Janata Curfew Pledge, Stay Home Stay Safe Pledge and Fight Against Corona &ndash; which saw participation of lakhs of people. The Citizens Ideas and Suggestions page on COVID19 saw more than 100,000 suggestions coming from citizens. The Innovation Challenge for tech solutions launched on MyGov led to brilliant ideas and solutions &ndash; including those on Contact Tracing which has now evolved into Aarogya Setu app. Quiz on COVID19 has seen almost 100,000 entries. These initiatives help people get involved and once they are engaged, they feel part of the overall solution to the COVID19. It has been very important part of our communications strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of the Aarogya Setu app is an important part of the COVID19 campaign. Given the questions raised by some with regard to privacy issues, it was essential to communicate clearly about what the App does, why it is required and how Privacy is built into the App by design. This was done by innovative use of graphics and videos. Even celebrities like Ajay Devgn helped in creating the #SetuMeraBodyguard campaign which was also endorsed by similar videos by regional language superstars like Nirahua in Bhojpuri and Anuj Sharma in Chhattisgarhi. Top cricketers helped in the #TeamMaskForce campaign that promoted use of Masks. Campaigns around these hashtags were launched on Social Media platforms that helped in getting user generated content even in regional languages that contributed to carrying the message far and wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lockdown instructions were a major challenge for us. Feedback was that many people were finding it difficult to interpret the directions and there was confusion on what to do and what not to. Immediately, MyGov demystified the directions and instructions by coming up with simple, easy to read and understand infographics which became very popular. These were also translated in various languages with help and support of a volunteer group who did it pro bono. With Lockdown, came the challenge of migrants and there was a lot of issue regarding Shelter homes and feeding centres for the poor and urban homeless. MyGov collaborated with Google Maps and Map My India and put details of Shelters and Feeding Homes of around 750 cities on Maps so that they become easy to find and locate. Google also launched a messaging service for MyGov on Google Maps which has been integrated with the Saathi Chatbot to answer queries instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Myth Busters infographic was released, it became viral and millions of people shared it. A suggestion was received to make it available in audio format. Accordingly, these as also COVID19 updates were converted into Audio Podcasts as part of MyGov Samvaad. These podcasts were also shared with more than 200 Community Radio Stations who translated the content and helped expand the outreach of COVID19 messaging. Further, it was felt that we also need to address anxiety, stress specially for people during the Lockdown. So, an initiative called Positive Harmonies was launched in which prominent musicians from across the country created special numbers for MyGov along with their messages to help manage the crisis. This has become very popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One key feature of all these endeavours have been that all of this was managed by our teams &ndash; working from home. Team members collaborated across cities and came up with brilliant innovations. We were greatly benefitted with collaborations with top tech companies, media, volunteers and various Government departments. Innovation &amp; Collaboration seems to be our strength that has not only helped us in our communications but will ultimately help us tide this crisis also.</p>\r\n', 7, '412.png', '2020-08-09', 2),
(24, 'COVID-19 creates new momentum for cycling and walking', '<p>COVID-19 creates new momentum for cycling and walking. We can&rsquo;t let it go to waste! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our cities in many ways. While the number of motor vehicles on the road has plummeted during lockdown, an increasing number of people have turned to walking and biking, moving speedily and safely through once congested streets. The shift has brought some visible changes: local air pollution has dropped by up to 60% globally, and cities that used to be covered with a thick blanket of smog are experiencing their first blue skies in a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what will happen now that cities are gradually getting out of lockdown? At the moment, many urban residents feel that public transport puts them at a higher risk of being infected, and perceive private vehicles to be safer. As a result, car use has recovered much faster than mass transit so far&mdash;morning traffic in major Chinese cities is now even higher than 2019 averages. That means higher levels of air pollution, more congestion, and a lower quality of life. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there is an alternative to rampant motorization. If the current public health crisis makes individual modes inherently more appealing to users, why not use this as an opportunity to promote cycling and walking, which would produce greater social benefits, reduce pollution, and improve urban livability?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are seeing encouraging signs in some cities, where traffic on urban cycling networks is surging. For example, in Buenos Aires city bike use increased 129% before total lockdown and a similar increase was observed on China&rsquo;s bikeshare systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet in many parts of the world, the conditions for cyclists and pedestrians remain extremely challenging. In India, only 10% of urban streets have sidewalks, resulting in high fatality rates for non-motorized transport (NMT) users. In Africa, pedestrians and cyclists account for 44% of road traffic fatalities. The situation is simply not acceptable&mdash;no one should have to feel like they are gambling with their life every time they decide to walk down the street or hop on a bike. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o, why is non-motorized transport lagging so far behind? After all, cities around the world have laid out plans and manuals to encourage cycling and upgrade walking infrastructure, often in an effort to improve air quality. The required facilities are relatively inexpensive to build, and there is no shortage of guidelines on how to best design safer streets for walking and biking. It seems like the problem is less about capacity and more about opportunity: due to many competing agendas of city governments, the car has largely dominated the fierce competition for urban space. This is one of the main reasons why NMT plans rarely move from design to implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disruption created by COVID-19, however, has significantly changed people&rsquo;s perception of walking and biking, leading many decisionmakers to rethink the role of active transport. In fact, several major cities have already seized that momentum to advance their urban sustainability agenda. From Lima and Bogot&aacute; in Latin America, to Berlin and Milan in Europe as well as Kisumu in Kenya or Auckland in Oceania, more than 1,800 cities have taken action to bolster NMT since the start of the pandemic. India put in place a nationwide program known as the Cycles4Change Challenge. Some of the concrete NMT measures that have been adopted in response to COVID-19 include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closing certain streets to motorized vehicles. In Oakland, the city closed nearly 10% of its streets.<br />\r\nExpanding NMT space or creating new priority zones for cyclists and pedestrians, such as Vienna&rsquo;s &ldquo;shared spaces&rdquo; (&ldquo;Begegnungszonen&rdquo;).<br />\r\nCreating temporary or &ldquo;pop-up&rdquo; bike lanes through low-cost interventions (signage, traffic cones, concrete barriers), as seen in Lima or Berlin<br />\r\nProviding equipment and finance e.g. bike provision, bike commuter benefits, shower facilities at workplaces. In India, for instance, the Cycles4Change Challenge is helping cities build capacity to launch bike-share systems or create pop-up bike lanes. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through the lockdown, city dwellers have experienced urban space free from noisy traffic for the first time since the rise of the automobile. Many have rediscovered walking and biking, filling city streets with people rather than cars. Amid all the chaos, the pandemic has given us a glimpse into what a pedestrian-friendly, bike-friendly city could look like, with fewer road fatalities, less pollution, and a better urban environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cannot be just a passing fad: now that the pandemic has opened our eyes to the importance of non-motorized transport, we have a small window of opportunity to transform short-term responses into long-term change&mdash;and to create livable, breathable cities for all.</p>\r\n', 22, '495.jpg', '2020-08-09', 2),

Many of the beds in their facility are for people with COVID-19, who may need ventilators as part of their treatment. Aside from the ventilators, the hospital is filled with the sounds of electricity: heart monitors, lights and other necessities for an effective health facility. But, unlike many hospitals in rural India and elsewhere, the doctors do not have to worry about what would happen if the power went out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hospitals rely on safe, reliable energy to treat patients, and lack of power can be harmful &mdash; if not deadly &mdash; to people seeking treatment. Nav Jivan faced many operational challenges that are common for rural hospitals, especially due to erratic electric supply and regular voltage fluctuations. That&rsquo;s why, in January, Nav Jivan installed a 10-kilowatt peak (kWp) solar photovoltaic (PV) system on its premises. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This technology has given the hospital a new lease on life.

As COVID-19 began spreading across the world and governments struggled to set up competent medical support in urban and rural areas, this small hospital was ready. Rural areas face unique risks due to the pandemic, concerning many global health experts, and Nav Jivan shows the life-saving value of sustainable energy in areas where electricity remains unreliable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rural Healthcare and COVID-19<br />\r\nCOVID-19 has expanded its footprint across India, with over 264,944 active cases and 20,642 deaths as of July 8. A robust, resilient healthcare system has been identified as vital to contain its spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On any ordinary day, healthcare centers in remote areas face challenges due to location; limited access to resources, medical supplies and equipment; staff shortages and other factors. The coronavirus pandemic has left these hospitals struggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixty-six percent of India&rsquo;s population resides in villages, making the need to prepare rural healthcare infrastructure and sub-centers for the crisis extremely urgent. As of 2019, at least 30% of sub-centers (SC) &mdash; which provide basic health care to communities &mdash; in 14 states did not have an electricity connection. This accounts for almost 40,000 SCs throughout the country. Although primary health centers (PHCs) are more likely to have electricity, almost 800 PHCs in India operate without it. &nbsp;Data shows that cities with populations of between 20,000 and 50,000 accounted for over half of confirmed COVID-19 cases in early July.<br />\r\nNav Jivan is one of the main healthcare facilities in Jharkhand state in eastern India. Over 75% of the state&rsquo;s population resides in rural areas. Palamu, a district in Jharkhand, is in the state&rsquo;s top 15 districts affected by COVID-19. The hospital, serving over 450 villages, has beds ready in the intensive care unit for severe and moderate cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proactive steps taken by Nav Jivan Hospital towards improving its services over the years &mdash; and more recently, fortifying its electricity supply with decentralized solar power &mdash; have played a significant role in enhancing self-reliance and improving disaster-management capabilities for this rural hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strengthening Health Systems with Reliable Energy<br />\r\nNav Jivan&rsquo;s progress and advancement in facilities was based on years of judicious planning and forethought. For several years, limited infrastructure required the hospital to perform surgeries and child deliveries with flashlights and petromax lamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation improved considerably when it got three-phase grid connections, but voltage fluctuations combined with frequent and long power outages continued to hamper operations. In addition, inevitable damage to the electricity grid during monsoons led to prolonged periods of power outages, forcing the hospital to depend on expensive (up to over $13,000, or Rs.10 lakh, per year) and polluting diesel generators. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even as the hospital administration searched for alternatives, a doctor who was part of the team made an investment towards the end of last year, funding the installation of its first solar PV system. This 10kWp system takes care of the hospital&rsquo;s most critical needs, functioning as the primary source of power for running equipment required for treating COVID-19 patients. Solar energy powers the ICU ventilators, including additional ventilators procured from the state for emergencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating Resilient Rural Health Systems<br />\r\nThis pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on world communities, could be a turning point for India&rsquo;s rural healthcare landscape &mdash; provided we learn from it and enhance our capacities through sustainable, energy-efficient systems. Focusing on leaving no community behind must be part of building resilience and enhancing preparedness of our healthcare systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nav Jivan is an example of how, with improved access to reliable energy, rural hospitals can upgrade basic and critical-care services. Decentralized renewable energy can empower rural hospitals by providing uninterrupted services, reducing diesel costs and pollution and improving financial efficiency. To achieve this, it is important to build national- and state-level dialogue on the need for resilient healthcare delivery systems through integrated policies, sustainable technology solutions and innovative financing models.</p>\r\n', 22, '889.jfif', '2020-08-09', 0),
(27, 'Protect yourself and others from the spread COVID-19', '<p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.<br />\r\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.<br />\r\nAvoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).<br />\r\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.<br />\r\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.<br />\r\nStay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.<br />\r\nIf you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.<br />\r\nKeep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safe use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers<br />\r\nTo protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children&rsquo;s reach. Teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use.<br />\r\nApply a coin-sized amount on your hands. There is no need to use a large amount of the product.<br />\r\nAvoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as it can cause irritation.<br />\r\nHand sanitizers recommended to protect against COVID-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable. Do not use before handling fire or cooking.<br />\r\nUnder no circumstance, drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It can be poisonous.&nbsp;<br />\r\nRemember that washing your hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19.</p>\r\n', 23, '785.jpg', '2020-08-09', 0),
